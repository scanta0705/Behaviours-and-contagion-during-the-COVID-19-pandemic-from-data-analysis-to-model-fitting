README - PHASE 2

Phase 2 starts from the FULL_DATA5_FINALE.csv file generated in Phase 1.

The Python scripts should be run in this order to ensure correct results for phase 2:

- correlations.ipynb
- randomforestregression.ipynb

The face-covering-policies-covid.csv file is retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/face-covering-policies-covid

The lines responsible for saving the images must be commented out or modified to ensure the proper functioning of the code.
